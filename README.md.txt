# Lightweight Detection of Heart Sound Abnormalities

This repository contains the code and materials for my Master's thesis:

**A Lightweight Predictive Model for the Detection of Heart Sound Abnormalities**

## Overview
This project explores a computationally lightweight and interpretable
machine-learning pipeline for classifying heart sound recordings using
MFCC-based features and classical ML models.

## Contents
- `src/` – R scripts for download and feature extraction, Model training and Telegrambot
- `data/` – Processed feature dataset (no raw audio) after feature extraction. (optional) 
- `models/` – Trained model artifacts and preprocessing objects
- `thesis/` – Full thesis PDF

## Dataset
- Primary dataset: Wadahupy/Heartbeat-Sounds-Dataset
- Raw audio files are not included.

## Reproducibility
All preprocessing steps and trained models are saved and reused during inference.
Note: make sure to update the path of each of the files or be sure they are available in the same folder.
